Title: "Vibrant Flux: A Generative Art Journey"

Description:

"Vibrant Flux" is a unique exploration into the dynamic world of generative art, inspired by the geometric structure of Fidenza and the bold color palettes of Mark Rothko. This project encapsulates the unpredictable beauty of algorithmic creations, merging mathematical precision with organic randomness.

Each piece in this series is a living entity. It starts as a grid of ultra-fine lines, almost like film grain, that then morph and sway like waves, creating a mesmerizing ebb and flow of colors and forms. The colors are drawn from a carefully curated palette, blending deep maroons, earthy oranges, dark greys, and light beige with a distinctive 'Pulp Fiction' yellow.

Adding an extra layer of interactivity, the intensity of the ambient light within each piece changes with the user's mouse position, and the 3D forms rotate in response to this interactivity, creating an ever-changing landscape of color and light. Furthermore, the project incorporates the Japanese character for 'Ikigai', symbolizing a journey towards finding purpose, adding a deeper layer of meaning to the visual experience.

"Vibrant Flux" pushes the boundaries of generative art, inviting viewers into an immersive, interactive experience. It's not just an art series; it's a journey into a digital world of color, light, and movement, where every moment brings a new, unique creation to life.
